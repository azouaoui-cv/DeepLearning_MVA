# DeepLearning_MVA
Homeworks in the Deep Learning course by Vincent Lepetit

## Mini-Project 1
The goal of this project is to learn how to implement simple image classification and regression
in Keras

### Requirements
I used Python 3.6 on (Mini)conda to complete the assignment.

The virtual environment can be activated using: ``conda create --name dl --file conda-env.txt``

The python packages are then installed using pip: ``pip -r requirements.txt``
